## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run a specific test module:

```bash
pytest tests/core/test_data_validation.py
```

To run a specific test function:

```bash
pytest tests/core/test_data_validation.py::test_validate_price_data_basic
```

## Test Coverage

To run tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
pytest --cov=core
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing structure, putting tests in the directory matching the module being tested
2. Use the `pytest` fixtures from `conftest.py` for common test data
3. Use clear, descriptive test names that indicate what is being tested
4. Include docstrings for each test function explaining what is being tested
